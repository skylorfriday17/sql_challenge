# SQL Challenge
---
## Description
In this challenge we were looking at data on employees for a company in the 80's and 90's. I was tasked with creating a quick data model of the CSV files I was given to put into a SQL database. I was also required to create a SQL table schema in order to import the CSV files into the SQL database correctly. Lastly I was asked to complete various queries with the employee database in order to uncover the data which I was tasked to find. All of these you will find in the EmployeeSQL folder of this repository!

### Resources
The only resources used for this challenge were the class material and Xpert Learning Assistant AI Tool provided by DU.
